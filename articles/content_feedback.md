## Feedback by (GPT powered) experts!

I've wanted to share my thoughts, ideas and descriptions of what I encounter
in my professional life.

I long to be one of those who share useful blog posts!

But, I struggle. I tend to write dry and formally. I often write in a formal
'deduction' mode.

My texts could look like:
```
A, My thinking tends to be oriented towards axioms and dependencies 
B. When I want to share a thought, it is just that, I'm sharing how I think
---------------------------------- 
âˆ´ My writing tends to look like propositional logic
```

## Tell a story!
### Great ideas are best transmitted as stories!
I've been told, over and over again, that I should introduce ideas as stories.
"You need to tell a story".

I struggle with the concept. I searched on-line for concrete tips, but all I could
find where concepts such as "tell a story about a person2 "use cliff-hangers", 
"take the reader on a journey".

## Find a place to get help
I listened to a talk about using ChatGPT for programming.
I got _very_ inspired, I could ask ChatGPT for coaching, from different perspectives.

This is what drove me to create this site!

I can now get feedback on what I write, and concrete suggestions on how to improve 
the writing from several different perspectives!
