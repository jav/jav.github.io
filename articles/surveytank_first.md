### Chapter 1 - inception and first prototype
###### 2023-09-10

A few months ago, a new idea was birthed.

Cisterns, oil separators and similar need continuous inspections to bee legal (approximately every fifth year).

The initial idea was to sell a reminder-service. To allow a user to "fire and forget" about their cisterns. That we'll make sure to remind you when it's time to inspect your cisterns.

**Estimating TAM (Total adressable market)**

Initial scope will be farmers in Sweden.
In 2015, there where approximately 60 000 farms in Sweden [source](https://jordbruketisiffror.wordpress.com/tag/antal-bondgardar-i-sverige/)

I guesstimate that each farm has at least three cisterns.

Each cistern needs to be inspected approximately every fifth year.

`60 000 Â· 3 / 5 ~= 36 000` yearly inspections.


Charging 100 SEK for each reminder, would give a TAM-value of 3 600 000 SEK per year.

Suggesting that this won't be a life-changing enterprise.
However, the market could be expanded to other segments once the individual agricultural company ("farmers") have been won.

Either way, it'd be a fun project and perhaps could lead to some good writeups :)

After some thinking, I decided to update the business model to be free-reminders, but that with the reminders, people would also get a few competitive offers for the inspections. The assumption is that, at some point, I could get a kickback from the chosen contractor.

**First prototype**:

Budget c:a 1000 SEK

Register the sites `reservoirkraft.com` with `name.com` and later change my mind and also register `sanitetskollen.se` :), I registered the `.se` through `Loopia`. They charge extra for their DNS service (only 89SEK), but I'm already using `afraid.org` for free, so I went ahead and registered there.

I added a google workspace subscription for the sites.

I used `Brandmark.com` to get a logo and some site-colors.
I won't use Brandmark again for this use case. The logo is an SVG of a font-face, which I could have found for free and used a free service to find good colors for a website. Brandmark cost ~700 SEK. Not a prohibitive amount, but it did lead me to break the budget.

I threw together a website in google sites and also a short form, asking people to choose a date to be reminded and how they'd like to be reminded.

ChatGPT helped me with the copy, in Swedish.

I ended up spending approximately `1 500 SEK`, which I think is fine.

I reached out an old colleague of mine whose parents had a farm and asked for contact details.

**Current state**

  * I now have a website `sanitetskollen.se`, with some explaining copy and a form for prospective users to send me their contact details.
  * I have contact details to one person to interview about the use case
  * I have spent approximately `1 500 SEK`


**Next step**

Reach out to my friends father to better understand their needs.
