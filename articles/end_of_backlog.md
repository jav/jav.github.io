# A law of nature of backlogs

Or, "why don't we ever work on that item that has been the second
highest priority for over a year now?"

I find myself in situation where a team member expresses: "New things
keep coming in! When will we ever get to the end of the backlog?"

We'll never get to the end of the backlog.

We shouldn't.

The last item is the one with the lowest value / effort ratio.

We look to celebrate the completion of each piece of value we bring to
our stakeholders.

## The structure of the backlog.

The backlog consists of stories. Each story aims to be a self-contained
succes. Delivering value to our stakeholders.

> **The backlog is sorted in order of priority**
>
> Items at the top of the backlog are items of higher priority. =\> High
> value / effort ratio.
>
> Items at the bottom of the backlog are items of lower priority. =\>
> Low value / effort ratio.

### The impact of working on the backlog

We consume the backlog from the top.

High priority items are worked on (eventually removed).

Low priority items stay in the backlog.

> **Lemma 1**: If no items are added to the backlog, then the average
> value / effort of items in the backlog will continually lower
> 
> 1.  Higest priority items are worked on, completed and removed from the backlog.
>
> 2.  Low priority items are not worked on and hence remain in the backlog
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> ∴ High priority items are removed, low priority items linger. Over
> time lowering the average priority of items in backlog

## New things are added to the backlog

Stakeholders as "high pass filters"

Any stakeholder (ourselves included) may suggest items to the backlog.
This means that, any added item, has passed the filter of a stakeholder
judging the item of being high enough importance to be suggested to the
backlog.

Stakeholders won't choose items they themselves consider unimportant.

**Accepting items to the backlog as a "high pass filter"**

Another filter, is accepting the item to the backlog. Low value or low
priority items may be blocked from making it to the backlog at all.

**These filters are stochastic**

An important detail about these filters are their stochastic nature.
High value items have a higher likelihood of passing the filter. Lower
value items will have a lower likelihood of passing the filter.

> **Lemma 2**: New it\'ems inserted to the backlog tend to have higher
> than average value / effort ratio.
>
> 1.  New items are considered important by the stakeholder contributing it
> 
> 2.  The backlog rejects items of low value / effort ratio
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> ∴ New items have a bias to be of higher value / effort ratio

## The resulting law of nature impacting backlogs

> **Lemma 1 + Lemma 2**
> 
> 1.  "High priority items are removed and low priority items linger. Over    time lowering the average priority of items in backlog"
>
>2.  "New items have a bias to be of higer value / effort ratio"
>
>-----------------------------------------------------------------
> ∴ In a maturing backlog, new items will have a bias towards having a
> higher value / effort ratio than the backlog average.

## BUT THERE IS HOPE!

It *is* possible to experience the joy of completion!

Completion doesn\'t have to be measured by "Did we reach the bottom of
the backlog?"

Completion can be about:

"Did we succeed to deliver new joy to our users?".

By scoping our work into smaller pieces, where each brings value. We can
celebrate the completion of each, regardless of how many remain.
