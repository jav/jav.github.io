### Don’t _ever_ develop without a customer waiting and longing for your product!

Whenever you start working on a story, you start creating risk.
Risk that you are on the wrong path.

Odds are most likely on your side, and this risk will transform into a beautiful delivery.
However, the risk builds fast over time (it gets worse very quickly).

The more time you spend on a delivery, the less likely it is to give you the reward you are hoping for.
You want to cash in quickly on your efforts. Each delivery to customer is a check-point.
Both for extracting value (will it be useful to some one?) as well as as a reality-check (where our assumptions right?).

Our working environment changes quickly, and in all likelyhood, either the inital assumptions
where not fully accurate, or the goal (the actual need) will have changed over time.

Having a customer knocking on the door, however small the customer is the first
piece of evidence that there is a need.
An actual customer also carries other advantages to the team.
A team may derrive their satisfaction of completion, not only in solving the hardest
technical challenges, but also the satisfaction of delivering something useful,
to some one whose life is made slightly better.
A team that is brought closer to an actual customer may also better understand the
end need, may also contribute intellectually to solutions, solutions beyond complying
to a provided technical specification.

Any thing you build can be built iteratively, with incremental deliveries.
It is unlikely, but fully conceivable that something is not buildable in an iterative manner.
However, for this unlikely case, you should consider.
Is the added risk really defendable from a business perspective?
Should you choose to bet on a high-risk product or a low-risk one?
Don’t forget that a product starts “generating revenue” from the moment it is
delivered, and not before.
