# [](#header-1) The literal product owner
### An antipattern
###### 2017-10-03

It is common that a new product owner, taking the name of the role
literary, feels that they _exclusively_ own:

- the products vision
- the products backlog, and
- the communication with the users and stakeholders.

Putting your self, as a product owner, in the center of all
communications, will make you a bottleneck and a risk for the entire
team.  All three aspects mentioned are best owned by the team, and
facilitated by the product owner.  A good sampling point for success
is to observe if these activities continue even when you, the product
owner, is absent.
