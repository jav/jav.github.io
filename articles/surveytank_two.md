### Chapter 2 - A first user-interview
###### 2023-09-11

I called a farmer today.

The father of an old colleague of mine.

Inspection costs are negligible to him. He'll happily just take the first offer for an inspection.

`∴ he's not interested in comparing offers.`

As he recalls it, there's a metal plaque at the tank-top, that says when it needs to be inspected.

`∴ reminders are not useful to him`

He did suggest to check with foresters, who have a lot of diesel cisterns.


In a later conversation during the day, I got two tips:
1. Check with municipalities and similar, organizations who are operationally responsible for sites that have to have backup-generators.
2. Check with road-work companies, they might want to offload that work.
3. Check with 'verkstadsansvarig' people

I'm going to follow up on nr3. Looking up 20 individuals on LinkedIn with the title 'verkstadsansvarig' and checking in with them.
