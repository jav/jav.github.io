# [](#header-1) Influencing what we do, influencing the plan
### What we build is driven by what our users/customers want.
###### 2023-03-25

In 1-1 with my team-members, I have often heard the concern that they aren't being heard when wanting to influence priorities. Occationally, I too have experienced this frustration. An inability to contribute to priorities in a constructive and informed way.
To me, this frustration has always stemmed from an insufficient understanding of the end-user needs.

What we build is driven by what our users/customers want.
Our decisions are driven by our understanding of what the users want.

This means that intimate knowledge of what our users want, and insight into what will have the largest positive impact for them, will always be the determining factor in what we choose to build.

Anyone who wants to feel the satisfaction of being an active participant in the decision of what we build needs to be in tune with customer wants.

Not having an intimate understanding of what customers want limit one's ability to influence how we solve problems.
Problem solutions that cite concrete user needs and wants will always trump solutions that can't do the same.

**In summary**:
To be a constructive and informed participant in prorities one needs to carry an insight in what our users needs are.
