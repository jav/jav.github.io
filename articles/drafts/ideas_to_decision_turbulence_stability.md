# [](#header-1) Beeing a part of the decision birthing
### A decision is born as a rough idea and stabilizes over time
###### 2023-09-01


I've often receive the ask, or the feedback that team members want to feel more ownership and influence decisions and our direction more.

It's an ask that I celebrate.

Participating more in the earlier stages of decisions means to participate closer to the stage when the decision is just one idea amon many.
It means that the participant needs to accept turbulence and uncertainty.

Ideas change, a lot, they mix with other ideas or change as new insights arise, they get de-prioritized or put on hold.

It is a turbulent and change-filled process, and I love to invite too.

I like to describe it as a scale and maintain a continous dialogue with my coworkers about where on the scale they are most comfortable right now.

```
idea inception                               detailed decisions made
      |-------------------------------------------------|
  turbulent                                          stable

```

In my own experience, everyone tends to place their favourite place in the turbulent end.
Also, often, individuals discover that they are happier some where in between the two extremes.

The beauty of inviting our co-workers to make this discovery lies in that they can let go of their frustrations, as they're both invited to participate and that  participation expectations can be communicated. The co-worker can them selves understand and discover where on the scale they can contribute the most.
