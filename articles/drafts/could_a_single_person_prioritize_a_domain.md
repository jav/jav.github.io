Could a single person effectively understand-, and prioritise the needs of 
stakeholders for a domain?


I think that, for a "Platform as a Product" organization, 
it's better to size and match domains & teams according to how well a 
single person is able to manage from a stakeholder management and work/value 
prioritization perspective.

I've been reading Team topologies. In the chapter on "Team-first thinking", 
there is a section where they talk about  "Limit the Number and Types of 
Domains per Team" and "Match Software Boundary to Team Cognitive Load".

Team topologies seem to address engineers' cognitive load in its four 
heuristics to match domains per teams.

In short, the heuristics are:
Heuristic one suggests choosing one team per domain. If a domain is too large,
split it.
Heuristic two, three and four boil down to that a team should be at most 7-9
people, and should have either a single complex domain or (exclusively) a few
simple domains.

The complexity of a domain, as described by Team topologies, focuses on 
Intrinsic-, Extraneious- and Germane- cognitive loads. These impact the speed
of development (efficency) rather than the ability to choose the right things
to work on (effectiveness).

We should invest in lowering the cognitive load from a value perspective.
How often do we need to spend time, paying the cognitive load cost for a domain.
I.e. is it worth improving efficiency for this thing (be it a domain or a 
component).

The determining factor for how effective a team can deliver as a "platform as a
product team" lies in its ability to work on the right things, the things that
improve stakeholders situation.
Because we want every individual in the team to be able to understand
stakeholders, it turns out to be a challenge that dosen't scale with team size.

This boils down to that, when reasoning about domain sizing and team matching,
one can simplify the problem by replacing "team" with "a single person" to:

"Could a single person effectively manage, understand, and prioritise the needs
of stakeholders for this domain/these domains?"
