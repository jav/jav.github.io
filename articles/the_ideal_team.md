# [](#header-1) The ideal team; autonomous and pragmatic
### Pragmatism on delivering to the customer and autonomy are not mutually exclusive
###### 2017-10-03

A perpetual challenge for me has always been to preserve my teams
autonomy, a property I value highly. However, too often a false
dichotomy presents it self.  A trade off between autonomy and
pragmatism. Do you want the team to feel ownership of what they
deliver or do you want the team to deliver what would deliver most
value to your customer in the shortest possible time?

It is a false dichotomy.

It might not be easy to have both, but it can be done, and it must be
done if you want to succeed!

> *Without autonomy, the team will fail.*

A team which is not empowered to make decisions about the product and
its development will struggle to move. Either because of crippling
dependencies, on other teams or on a decision maker. Or be unable to
move forward due to the burden of an unmaintainable pile of hacks.
The team needs to feel ownership of the product and it's quality.

Youâ€™ll find yourself building the perfect next-gen system, which will
solve every problem in the world, if you could only add that one more
feature. You'll also discover that you end up, either delivering too
late, or that the accuracy to what the customer actually wanted
suffers greatly. It is easy to end up here when your team is focused
about the solution, and not the problem.

By creating an environment where you allow the team to love the
product, to love what they produce, you gain a team which feels
ownership and responsibility of what they do. A team that loves their
product will add those innovative improvements and take those
initiatives you wish you had come up with yourself.
