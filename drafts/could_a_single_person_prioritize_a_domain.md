# [](#header-1) Merge or split the domain and team?
### Could a single person effectively understand-, and prioritise the needs of stakeholders for a domain?
###### 2023-03-21

As I was reading team-topologies parts on  "Limit the Number and Types of Domains per Team" and "Match Software Boundary to Team Cognitive Load" I was reminded on how I've worked with sizing domains and matching them with teams which I wanted to share:


For a "Platform as a Product" organization, it's more effective to size and match domains & teams according to how well a single person is able to manage from a stakeholder management and a work/value prioritization perspective.


**My reasoning and the team-topologies perspective:**

Team topologies seem to address engineers' cognitive load in its four heuristics to match domains per teams.

In short, the heuristics are:

**Heuristic one** suggests choosing one team per domain. If a domain is too large, split it.

**Heuristic two, three and four** boil down to that a team should be at most 7-9 people, and should have either a single complex domain or (exclusively) a few simple domains.

The complexity of a domain, as described by Team topologies, focuses on Intrinsic-, Extraneious- and Germane- cognitive loads. These impact the speed of development (efficency) rather than the ability to choose the right things to work on (effectiveness).
In short: I interpret the teams-topologies perspective to be more about the complexity of the software and the efficency of an engineer working with it.

Instead, I think we should invest in lowering the cognitive load from a value perspective.
Lets do the right things, over doing things the fastest.

The determining factor for chosing the right things to work on as a "platform as a product team" lies in its ability to work on the right things, the things that improve stakeholders situation.

And, because we want every individual in the team to be able to understand stakeholders, it turns out to be a challenge that dosen't scale with team size.

This boils down to that, when reasoning about domain sizing and team matching, one can simplify the problem by replacing "team" with "a single person" to:

"Could a single person effectively manage, understand, and prioritise the needs of stakeholders for this domain/these domains?"



(p.s.)

A competing thought is, "Can't the PO do the stakeholder management, and the engineers solve the technical problems?".

I think it is possible, and I think it's a recepie for using engineers as code-producers not as problem solvers ðŸ™‚
